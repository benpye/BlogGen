I have recently been working on some stuff using FPGAs. I have some new old tubes coming, this time VFDs and the obvious project is a clock. I have implemented a clock before, though it was with an MSP430, this time I have decided to implement the design using an FPGA. I've had the board sitting around for a while so it was time I finally did something. Currently I only have the logic implemented as I don't have the displays here yet so I can't test or implement the multiplexing. The code is available at my github.
